* Typo in the scanner: Episilon caused Epsilon to be read as a terminal, breaking many things
Correctness: 47
* Human-readable output has already involuted the next table, thus doesn't print the next sets.
YAML table: 14
* When printing epsilon in the YAMl table, you printed the empty string instead of EPSILON
* Does not detect non-LL1 grammars
* After that works well, although crashing is not pretty
